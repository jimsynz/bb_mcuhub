  The segby_v1 example app — a downstream CONSUMER of `:bb_mcuhub` (ADR-0003).

  It depends on the library via a Mix `path` dep (a hex/registry dep later, with
  no change to this app's shape) and owns its own root namespace (`SegbyV1.*`),
  referencing `BBMCUHub.*` only for library seams. It defines its OWN `Range` /
  `Led` value-types (the extension seam) and its own robot/hubs/controllers — the
  library carries the machinery; this app supplies device-specific logic.
