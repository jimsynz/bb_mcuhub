defmodule SegbyV1.Robot do
  @moduledoc """
  The segby_v1 robot (§09) — a two-wheel self-balancing bot, defined in the
  BeamBots DSL over a UART backplane (no CAN transceiver on hand).

  BeamBots sees ordinary components; it never sees the root hub or the wire tree
  below it. Each hub port surfaces as a thin `BBMcuhub.BBHub.Sensor` /
  `BBMcuhub.BBHub.Actuator` view; below that seam runs our COBS+CRC frame over
  UART, carrying `seq` and (for the IMU) `t_dev`, with the floor on the wheels
  hub's own chip.

  Two hubs (ADR-0006: topology is DECLARED by parent links):

    * the **Blaster** (NODE 0x02) is the root comms hub (`parent: :host`) — it
      owns the host UART and senses pose (the MPU-9250 IMU) and a forward range
      (the HC-SR04), and drives a decorative WS2812 status strip. The wheels leaf
      hangs off it over a UART link.
    * the **Wheels** (NODE 0x05) is the leaf — ONE MKS Dual FOC board driving
      both wheels, so it takes two effort commands (left/right) and reports two
      statuses. Its parent link is UART (`parent: :blaster, uplink: :uart`).

  The host control pipeline lives in `SegbyV1.Balance` — a robot-level
  `BB.Controller` placed in the `controllers do` block below. It consumes the
  `chassis_imu` pose and produces per-wheel effort commands (it is a pure
  consumer+producer across the BeamBots seam; the actuator views remain the
  single writers of the command slots, §04). It starts DISABLED.

  The hub-gateway DSL (`BBMcuhub.Dsl`) composes alongside BeamBots' own: the
  `hubs do` block places each hub on a NODE id and the views in `topology` name
  the hub+port they read.
