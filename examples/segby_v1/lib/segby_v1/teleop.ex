defmodule SegbyV1.Teleop do
  @moduledoc """
  The segby_v1 operator-teleop command (§09) — the bridge from `bb_tui`'s
  operator surface into the balance controller's teleop loop.

  `bb_tui` has no built-in "teleop" concept; its write surface is the declared
  `commands` panel (run via `BB.Robot.Runtime.execute/3`), the joints panel
  (`BB.Actuator.set_position!/3`), and arm/disarm. Driving the wheels straight
  from the joints panel would fight `SegbyV1.Balance`, which is the *sole*
  commander of the wheel actuators (the balance loop owns the wheels, §04
  single-writer). So operator drive is surfaced as THIS command instead.

  When `bb_tui`'s Commands panel runs `:teleop` with `forward` / `turn` floats
  (each clamped to `[-1.0, 1.0]` by the controller), this handler publishes a
  `BB.Message.Geometry.Twist` (`linear.x` = forward, `angular.z` = turn, the
  ROS-style convention) onto the balance controller's teleop topic
  (`[:teleop, :segby]`). The balance controller consumes that Twist and biases
  its next pose tick's per-wheel effort (mixed ONTO the balance torque). The
  command completes immediately — it is a single fire-and-forget intent update,
  not a long-running motion.

  Wired into segby's `commands do` block with `allowed_states [:*]` so an
  operator can teleop in any non-disarmed operational state.
