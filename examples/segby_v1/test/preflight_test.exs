defmodule SegbyV1.PreflightTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tier-0 hardware-in-the-loop **pre-flight** checks (see `BRINGUP.md`) — the
  software-side guarantees that, if wrong, would destroy hardware when you flash.
  These run the WHOLE host stack over the loopback transport (real COBS+CRC seam,
  no boards), and assert the **safety- and sign-critical** behaviours the
  happy-path `SegbyV1.HostTest` does not:

    1. **Pitch-sign self-consistency (host side)** — a forward tilt and a backward
       tilt must produce *opposite-sign* torques, and the host convention
       (+pitch → negative torque) must hold. This catches a flipped sign in the
       host control code. It does NOT certify the bot balances: the ABSOLUTE sign
       that decides "drive under the fall vs. amplify it" closes only through the
       motor phase wiring + encoder direction (`encoder.invert`) — a bench
       calibration (BRINGUP Stage 3/4), not a software constant. Verify pose-pitch
       tracks tilt with balance OFF, then confirm the wheel drives the correct way
       at low effort BEFORE enabling balance.
    2. **Born-stale / born-disarmed** — a leftover or single (non-advancing) pose
       must NOT be trusted; the controller produces no balance torque until it
       personally witnesses a `seq` advance since its own boot.
    3. **Command cadence keeps the on-chip floor armed** — while pose flows, the
       host emits commands fast enough (≤ the 100 ms floor window) that a real
       wheel's floor would stay armed; if the host stalls, the wheel floors. The
       floor itself is on the MCU (proven by the C harnesses); this asserts the
       host feeds it in time.
    4. **Status liveness is freshness-gated** — a stale "not floored" status reads
       as unknown, never as driving (so the dashboard can't show a false green).

  The companion `SegbyV1.GoldenFramesTest` captures the exact bytes the host emits
  for a known command, so you can diff a real board's RX against them at the bench.

  Run with: `mix test test/preflight_test.exs` (before flashing anything).
