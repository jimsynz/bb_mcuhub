defmodule SegbyV1.HostTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The segby_v1 host integration proof (§07/§09) — the WHOLE host stack stood up
  by the launcher (`SegbyV1.Host`) over the real COBS+CRC seam, with no hardware:
  the BeamBots tree (sensor + actuator views + the `:balance` controller + the
  `:teleop` command) plus the `LinkOwner` on a loopback transport.

  This is the LIBRARY-CONSUMPTION proof on the host side: every library reference
  here is a public seam (`BBMcuhub.Host`, `BBMcuhub.Contract.PortIndex`,
  `BBMcuhub.Host.LinkOwner`/`NodeRegistry`, `BBMcuhub.Wire.Codec`); the robot,
  controller, value-types, and the launcher wrapper are the consumer's own
  (`SegbyV1.*`). The loopback transport is the consumer's own copy over the
  library's public `BBMcuhub.Host.Transport` behaviour.

  Two end-to-end assertions:

    * **balance → wire**: synthetic pose injected at the wire, lifted by the
      chassis-IMU sensor view, fed to the (enabled) balance controller, turned
      into per-wheel Effort by the actuator views, drained by the LinkOwner —
      reaches the loopback's sent frames for BOTH wheel slots, as a decoded
      `:effort`. This is the full host pipeline through the real framing.

    * **teleop loop closed**: a teleop intent delivered the way `bb_tui` delivers
      it (running the declared `:teleop` command, which publishes a `Twist` onto
      the balance controller's teleop topic) BIASES the per-wheel effort on the
      wire — proving the operator-input loop from the dashboard reaches the
      controller's `last_teleop` and out to the wheels.

  We also prove the DATA PATH `bb_tui` reads (it is interactive, so it can't be
  driven headless): when segby is driven, the robot publishes on the BB PubSub
  paths `bb_tui` subscribes to (`[:sensor | _]`, `[:actuator | _]`), so the
  dashboard WOULD populate. Launch it for real with
  `mix bb.tui --robot SegbyV1.Robot`.
