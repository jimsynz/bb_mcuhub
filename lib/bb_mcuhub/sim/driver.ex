defmodule BBMCUHub.Sim.Driver do
  @moduledoc """
  The real-time loop that **closes the sim loop** for a virtual robot.

  The transport is the one and only hardware boundary: above it is the real host
  stack, below it the sim stands in for the wire, the hubs, the floors, the
  silicon, and the physical plant. `BBMCUHub.Sim.Transport` captures the outbound
  per-slot commands (a pure capture — no clock); **this Driver owns the loop** that
  reads them, advances the plant, and injects the resulting sensors back up the
  real stack as wire bodies. The loop lives here, NOT in the transport, so the
  transport's `send/2` stays a pure capture out of the `LinkOwner`'s call path and
  the loop+plant are independently restartable.

  ## The tick (default ~20 ms / 50 Hz)

      cmds          = Sim.Transport.take_commands(transport)   # newest per slot
      {sensors, st} = plant.step(cmds, dt_s, plant_state)      # advance physics
      for {node, port_id, type, value} <- sensors:
        body = Codec.encode_body(node, port_id, seq, t_dev, type, value, stamped?)
        send(owner, {:circuits_uart, :sim, body})              # inject up the stack

  `{:circuits_uart, :sim, body}` is **exactly** the inbound message shape the UART
  transport delivers, so the real `LinkOwner` decodes it unchanged: it
  `Codec.decode_body/1`s the body, writes the registry slot, the sensor view
  witnesses a fresh `seq` advance, and the published `BB.Message` flows to `bb_tui`
  and the control laws — every box above the transport is shipped code.

  ## Why `seq` must strictly advance (born-stale freshness)

  The host's freshness monitor is **born-stale**: a sensor view publishes NOTHING
  until it witnesses `seq` ADVANCE since its own boot (the floor design).
  So the Driver keeps a **per-slot `seq` counter that strictly increases** across
  ticks — if it reused a `seq`, the view would treat the reading as stale and the
  bot would never appear to move. The counter wraps `0xFFFF → 0` (the advance test
  is plain inequality, and a wrap-around step from `0xFFFF` to `0` is still an
  advance for the inequality check at the boundary the view actually uses — it
  compares against the last seq it saw, not a global monotone, so successive sends
  always look fresh as long as they differ from the immediately preceding one).

  ## Determinism: `dt`, `t_dev`, and `seq` are derived from the tick count

  The live loop uses `Process.send_after` for **wall-clock pacing** (a human is
  watching), but every *simulated* quantity is derived from the tick count and the
  tick period, **never** the wall clock:

    * `dt_s` is the fixed tick period in seconds (`tick_ms / 1000`).
    * `t_dev` for a stamped port is the accumulated simulated time in microseconds
      (`tick_count * tick_us`), so it advances monotonically and reproducibly. An
      unstamped port passes `0` (the codec ignores it).
    * `seq` is a per-slot counter incremented each time that slot is emitted.

  So the *sequence* of physics inputs is reproducible; only *when* ticks fire is
  wall-clock. A future deterministic test mode can drive the same plant on an
  explicit step count without changing the recipe.

  ## Robustness

  A malformed value-type value (an `encode_fields` `Map.fetch!` raising on a
  missing layout field) is caught **per sensor**, logged, and skipped — never
  crashing the loop, mirroring `LinkOwner.send_value/6`. On terminate the Driver
  calls `plant.close/1` so a plant releasing a `Port` or file shuts down cleanly.
