defmodule BBMCUHub.Sim.Transport do
  @moduledoc """
  A `BBMCUHub.Host.Transport` that stands in for the wire + hubs + silicon, so
  the real host stack runs unchanged against a simulated robot (the transport is
  the one and only hardware boundary).

  Instead of writing bodies to a UART, this transport **decodes each outbound
  body and captures the newest command value per actuator wire slot**
  (`{node, port_id}`). A sibling `BBMCUHub.Sim.Driver` reads those captured
  commands once per simulated tick, steps the plant, and injects the resulting
  sensor bodies back to the owner.

  This module is a **pure capture** — it owns no clock, no timer, no plant call.
  It only decodes + stores. The loop lives in `Sim.Driver`, not here:
  keeping the transport stateless about time is what lets the driver advance
  simulated time deterministically.

  ## Semantics

    * `send/2` decodes the body via the real `BBMCUHub.Wire.Codec.decode_body/1`
      and stores `{node, port_id} => value`, **overwriting** any prior value for
      that slot (newest wins). An undecodable body is dropped silently — mirroring
      how the real `LinkOwner` counts a `decode_fail` and moves on — so a torn or
      garbage body never crashes the transport.
    * `take_commands/1` returns the current **newest-per-slot snapshot** and does
      **not** clear it. The driver wants "the latest command for each slot right
      now"; if a read cleared the map, a slot that received no new command between
      two ticks would vanish, which is wrong. So the read is non-clearing: a slot
      persists until a newer command for it arrives.

  Inbound (hub → host) traffic is the driver's job, not this transport's. The
  only inbound concern here is recording the `owner` pid at `start_link` (the
  driver is later handed the transport + owner to inject sensor bodies).
